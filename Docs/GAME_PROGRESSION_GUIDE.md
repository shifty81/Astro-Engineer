## Tips for Optimal Progression

### Resource Management
- Stockpile materials before starting new phases
- Set up automated production early
- Build storage capacity before you need it
- Never run out of fuel (always carry extra)

### Research Strategy
- Unlock technologies just before you need them
- Don't bottleneck on research (build labs early)
- Parallel research: Ground lab + Station lab
- Prioritize unlocks that enable next phase

### Ship Building
- Start simple, iterate with experience
- Test designs in orbit before committing
- Keep backup ships (redundancy)
- Specialized ships > do-everything ships

### Risk Management
- Always have oxygen margin (2x consumption)
- Carry extra fuel (20% minimum)
- Save before risky operations
- Practice maneuvers in safe orbit first

## Conclusion

The progression system in Astro Engineer is designed to provide a sense of accomplishment at each stage while building skills for the next challenge. From your first tentative steps gathering iron ore to commanding a fleet of starships exploring distant galaxies, every phase teaches something new while rewarding mastery of previous systems.

The beauty of this progression is that there's no single "correct" path - players can focus on building, exploring, or efficiency, and all roads eventually lead to the stars.
